NOTE: Parameters load_model and save_model at the top of Lab1.py load and save a model
for a given data set respectively. I have the trained models corresponding to my 
training outputs in the folder to make grading easier. Also the variable plot calls
my function to create the bar graph instead of training or loading a model.


First, to improve the accuracy of the CNN I created different functions for each
data set that would create different layers in the CNN architecture. Then in 
each of these models I tuned the hyperparameters. I adjusted pool size, filter size,
number of layers, dropout, and number of epochs. To find the correct combination of
parameters I would start a couple training sessions on cuda and dump the training
outputs to txt files, and see what parameters optimized accuracy. I also added 
functionality to save and load the trained models, because training was such a 
time consuming process.
